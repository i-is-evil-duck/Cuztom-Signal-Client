# Native call implementation status (RingRTC, macOS)

_Last updated: 2026-09-24_

## Goal and scope

Cuztom Signal uses native RingRTC/WebRTC for calls. There is no `signal-cli`
subprocess and no virtual-audio-device bridge.

The supported release scope is **native 1:1 voice calling**. Group calls are
intentionally disabled until Signal membership proofs, group/member identity
derivation, SFU HTTP support, and opaque group signaling are implemented.

## Completed foundation

- `ringrtc` builds with `native` and `prebuilt_webrtc` features.
- The macOS RingRTC build uses `rust-core/scripts/grealpath` to provide the
  GNU-compatible `realpath -e` behavior required by RingRTC's build script.
- The dylib links the required CoreAudio/AudioToolbox/AVFoundation pieces.
- `sync::call_signal_part` lifts `CallMessage` envelopes out of the normal
  chat receive path, including ICE updates.
- Empty DataMessage control envelopes, including group-call updates, are
  filtered before roster/history rows are created. They no longer appear as
  blank messages with sender chips.

## Completed 1:1 path

### Rust/RingRTC

- Native `PeerConnectionFactory` and audio device initialization.
- Signal `CallMessage` offer/answer/ICE/hangup/busy signaling.
- Persistent bridge between RingRTC callbacks and the Rust worker loop.
- RingRTC `message_sent` / `message_send_failure` handling.
- ACI/PNI identity-key lookup from the protocol store.
- Native call start/accept/hangup C ABI commands.
- Legacy raw-SDP commands fail explicitly rather than pretending to work.

### Swift/macOS

- `RustCoreService` resolves the native symbols.
- `CallController` maps native signaling and state into a deterministic UI
  state machine.
- Incoming race handling for an offer that arrives before native `connected`.
- Incoming/outgoing/connecting/active/ended overlays.
- Mute, hangup, microphone permission, and elapsed connected time.
- Friendly caller names and Note to Self/You identity handling.
- Incoming-call local notification, deduplicated by call record and cancelled
  on answer/decline/hangup.

## Verification

- `cargo check`: passed.
- `cargo test --lib`: 6 tests passed.
- `cargo build --release`: passed.
- `swift build --product CuztomSignal`: passed with full Xcode.
- `swift test`: 38 tests passed.
- Fresh app/link smoke test reached linked sync and initialized native
  RingRTC.
- Two-client 1:1 voice call with microphone capture was manually verified.

## Group-call blocker

The group-call button remains disabled. The missing pieces are:

1. Signal external group membership-proof retrieval and validation.
2. RingRTC group ID and accepted-member ciphertext/key derivation.
3. RingRTC HTTP delegate implementation for SFU requests/responses.
4. Opaque group-call signaling transport.
5. Separate group-call FFI commands and Swift lifecycle/UI.
6. Two linked/native-client interoperability testing.

Do not route group-call data through the normal `DataMessage` chat path; doing
so would reintroduce the empty-control-envelope and group-routing class of
bugs.

## Known 1:1 limitations and follow-ups

- ICE currently uses public STUN servers. Signal's authenticated TURN relay
  list is not fetched yet.
- The current sender does not expose Signal's urgent-message flag, so a call to
  a fully offline phone may not produce a push notification.
- Ringtone/ringback audio and full system audio-route selection are not
  implemented.
- Video calling is not enabled in the production UI; the current supported
  call mode is voice.
- Group/video calls, CallKit, lock-screen call actions, multi-call handling,
  and persistent call history remain future work.
- APNs/PushKit, launch-at-login, and killed-app call delivery require a
  separate signed provider/APNs path and are not implemented.

## Call-related regression checks

Before changing call code, preserve:

- 1:1 audio remains usable when group-call work is disabled.
- Signal incoming call envelopes never become chat rows.
- Empty group-call/control updates never become chat rows.
- Incoming calls are deduplicated and notification state is cancelled when the
  call is answered, declined, or ended.
